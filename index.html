                            At FLY Studio our mission is to create an oasis in Toronto's Downtown Core that will offer you an environment to make positive changes to your body and mind through a unique variety of practises. We focus on taking your practise to new levels with the addition of the suspension element - when gravity does hold you back, you can literally soar. The practise may be new to you but our small classes will give you the opportunity to work with our instructors closely to ensure the fastest possible progress. No matter what your goals are, the combination of classes that are available at Fly Studio will get you where you want to be - come and see us today and you will see why.

                                <p class="profile-description">Lia's passion for movement began as a child when she practiced gymnastics and continued through years of dance. She was immediately hooked on Pilates after taking her first class. After a year of dedicated practice, Lia decided to pursue training to share the benefits of Pilates that she had experienced. Lia obtained certification to teach Pilates Mat from Body Harmonics in Toronto. Her approach to Pilates maintains that the exercises practiced are the vehicle which drive us towards increased mental and physical awareness, improved mobility, and strength. Her encouraging teaching style and keen eye for movement help clients improve their body awareness and alignment. She enjoys creating unique exercise modifications to promote greater ease of movement and healthy biomechanics. Lia is inspired by the changes she sees in front of her as she watches people build strength and make health a priority. Lia is dedicated to personalizing exercise programs to help each client reach their full potential in the studio and carry those skills over to everyday activities and sports. Pilates aside, when Lia isn't working you can probably find her travelling, diving, and trying new restaurants.</p>

                                <p class="profile-description">Yoga came into my life while I was still a busy university student in Vancouver, BC. I had been longing to find balance amongst my many interests and yoga was the practice that brought unification, and started me on a new path. After graduation I became more serious about my practice and in 2009 I completed my yoga teacher training at Prana Yoga College and have been teaching ever since. My dedication has granted me the opportunity to teach in many places and many styles. In addition to my exploration in yoga I decided to pursue a career in contemporary dance, a dream I always had. I enrolled in Simon Fraser University's post-bachelors diploma in contemporary dance where I spent 3 years furthering my knowledge of alignment, anatomy, injury prevention, bio-mechanics and physiology. In 2011 I became a certified Pilates instructor through the PhysicalMind Institute of Canada and recently I received my aerial yoga certification through P3 Yoga in Pickering, ON.</p>

Her passion for healing has guided her to attunements and trainings in several different healing modalities including Reiki, Reconnective healing and Theta healing. She is also certified as a traditional Thai masseuse, is an Unatta Aerial yoga teacher and is currently studying Eastern medicine to become an acupuncturist. Lori believes that personal growth is at the heart of yoga practice and therefore it is her goal as a facilitator to create a safe space for such cultivation. As an avid traveler, and an aspiring artist Lori receives inspiration from life experiences and thus is a strong advocate for living life in our highest potential. In her eyes all it takes is a sense of innocence and pliability for the generation of limitless possibilities because we are always on a path of continual change and progression. Lori welcomes you to come embark on this unknown journey with her to embrace and allow things to unfold from a place of love and compassion for yourself and others.</p>

                                <p class="profile-description">Everyone is drawn to yoga for different reasons and I love being a part of that journey. Yoga entered my life in 2006 thanks to Tracy and Jose Dos Anjos who opened Moksha Downtown in Toronto. It was there I took classes until it became my favourite "me time" activity. When I completed the Yoga Teacher Training with Balanced Life Yoga, I was excited to learn more. To date, I've been certified to teach Aerial and Pre and Post Natal Yoga. The practice of yoga is often misinterpreted. You don't have to be "bendy" and you don't have to be a zen master to stay focused during a class. All it takes is a commitment - just as it is with any sort of training. Once you become connected to your practice, be prepared to fall in love with your inner self. Forever grateful for the teachers that inspired me on my yogic path: Shasta Townsend, Angela Ryan, Krista Bromfield, Shawna Fujijki, Laura Avard, Suzanne Hennig, Sydnie Nicoll, Lisa Barkin, David Good and Carmen Puyo.</p>

                                <p class="profile-description">Balance is what keeps me happy in my life. Regular yoga practice has become a very important part in finding that balance by making me feel calm, grounded and motivated. I chose to become a yoga instructor so I could share this positive experience with people; encouraging them to feel good about moving their bodies and showing them how to release the tension that builds up in the daily grind. When I completed my teacher training in CorYoga, I became interested in anti-gravity yoga practice and completed teacher training in suspension yoga. Using the sling and the handles adds to your yoga practice experience off the floor. Suspension yoga will increase your body awareness, build balance and coordination, and release muscular tension as well as strengthen and tone your entire body. Be prepared to fly!</p>

At the suggestion of one of her fitness instructors she started her training in 2010. Jane first became a certified Pilates Mat instructor through Body Harmonics in Toronto, Ontario in 2010. Then in 2011, she became a certified C.O.R.E indoor cycling instructor. To fill out her certifications, Jane then pursued a certification in Yoga Tune Up Therapy Balls. These balls are used to administer self-massage. Jane led a number of workshops that introduced self-massage for the back, neck, shoulders, hips, and legs. She brings a sense of humour to her classes and strives to create a comfortable and safe environment for all of her students. Jane will offer modifications for many of the exercises included in her classes to ensure that each student feels confident in their movements. In her spare time Jane likes to paint and create screen prints on clothing for her friends and family.</p>

                                    A:  Absolutely not, your flight instructor will discuss your experience level with you and movements will be tailored to you.
                                </p>

                                </p>
                                <p class="fa-answer">  
                                    A:  At first look, the most notable difference is the equipment used. A silk hammock is used for Aerial yoga and a hammock, made of recycled parachute material with hand and foot handles is utilized for Suspension yoga. Aerial class movements are predominantly Asana yoga, which can be taken to another level because of the assistance of the silk. Suspension is a blend of yoga, body conditioning and stretching. The handles provide extra stability and a deeper stretch. Try both to find your favourite.  5, 10 and 20 class package pricing can be used for both.

                                <p class="fa-answer">  
                                    A:  Whether you are upside down or on the reformer, comfortable clothing that moves with you is good for all classes. Shoes are optional for Tabata, but unnecessary for the rest of our classes. Jewelry can get caught on Suspension and Aerial equipment so we ask that you don't wear any during your class.
                                </p>
